In November 2016, Bill Galston, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution and Bill Kristol, the founder of The Weekly Standard, penned a joint memo in which they made “the case for a New Center, one that does not split the difference between Left and Right, but offers a principled alternative to both.”
In subsequent months, Galston and Kristol convened an array of thinkers and leaders from across the political spectrum to help define the values and policies that animate The New Center, resulting in the Ideas to Re-Center America, which was released by the No Labels Foundation.
The New Center was created as a standalone independent entity in 2018 that develops original policy ideas and aggregates content.<br></br>
